# ASpecPy
Python Library for controling the AvaSpec starline spectrometer

Implementation of the library for the Python language allowing the use of this language to create an application that controls the work of the spectrometer and analyzes the absorbance measurements taken in automatic mode.
The scope of work includes enabling control of device operation parameters and making measurements based on technical documentation of the equipment manufacturer. Both the ULS2048CL-EVO-RS detector decoder and the AvaLight-DHc lamp are required. The library will operate in the Raspbian operating system environment running on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B + hardware platform.
